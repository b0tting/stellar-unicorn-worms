# Stellar Unicorn Worms

## Description
This is a demo for the Stellar Unicorn Worms led screen. It is a 16x16 led screen that can display animations and text, controlled by an Raspberry Pico 2040 microcontroller. This code is an object oriented approach to working with micropython, which works just great.

Worms crawl around, showing different behaviours and spiffy colors. The buttons on the back of the stellar have different functions: 
- Reset: resets the pico and restarts the animation
- Brightness up/down: cycles through different brightness levels
- A/B change the speed of the worms
- C/D to add or remove worms

## Installation
If working with pycharm, find the latest Micropython plugin at https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-micropython - at the moment of writing, the pycharm 2024 plugin was not yet available in the plugins store. Attach the Pico to your computer, clone this repo and code away!
